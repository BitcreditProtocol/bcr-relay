# Bitcredit Nostr Relay

A specialized Nostr relay implementation written in Rust for the Bitcredit application.

## Overview

This project provides a customized Nostr relay that powers the Bitcredit application, enabling decentralized, censorship-resistant communication with features specifically designed for credit-related transactions and interactions.

## Features

- **High-performance Rust implementation**: Built for speed, reliability, and memory safety
- **Bitcredit-specific event handling**: Custom event types and validation rules for credit-related operations
- **Scalable architecture**: Designed to handle high throughput of Nostr events
- **Authentication**: NIP-01, NIP-02, and custom authentication mechanisms
- **Data persistence**: Configurable storage backends for relay events
- **Filter optimization**: Enhanced query capabilities for Bitcredit-specific data

## Installation
